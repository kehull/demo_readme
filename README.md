# Project Title 

# Description
Write a short description of the project, i.e. "Perform exploratory data analysis on such-and-such dataset", or "Use such-and-such dataset to investigate the effects of X on Y", etc.

# Authors
Even if you're the sole contributor to the repo, you can credit yourself and include a link to your main Github page and Linkedin here. If there are multiple contributors, list all contributors, what role they played in the project, and link to their Github and Linkedin.

## Table of Contents 
This is only necessary if you have a very long README file.
If your file is long enough, you'll list all of your section headers here and link to them.

## Getting Started Guide
   - This is where you list anything necessary for a person to run your project on their machine.
   - This is where your [requirements.txt](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-requirements-file/) file goes. This file should only include packages used in this specific project- if you create a requirements.txt file and there are additional packages listed, delete them from your file before pushing it.
   - If there are any other special notes or settings that a person would need to know to run your project on their computer, include them here.

### Dataset Citation
Cite all datasets used in your project. At the very least, for each dataset you should list:
  - The name of the dataset
  - Authors of the dataset
  - A link to where the dataset can be found (if one is available)
  - The date the dataset was created by the authors
You can find an in-depth discussion of more formal ways to cite datasets [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Data_citation_guidance.html).

### Describe the datasets
Here you can describe the type of dataset (csv? API? Local SQL server?) and relevant attributes of the dataset. [Here](https://help.osf.io/article/217-how-to-make-a-data-dictionary) is an example of a detailed way you can document your dataset. You can also look at the documentation on Kaggle datasets for ways to document datasets. Here are a few examples of good dataset documentation:
  - [Life Expectancy Trends for Males and Females](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saimondahal/life-expectancy-trends-for-males-and-females)
  - [Guess Whoâ€™s Dataset:The Real Slim Shady yt stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/guess-whos-datasetthe-real-slim-shady-yt-stats)
  - [Top Goodreads Books Collection (1980-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ultimate-book-collection-top-100-books-up-to-2023)

### Process
This is optional. If you used any unusual packages or unique methods to generate your analysis, you can talk about it briefly here.

### Analysis
This is where you describe your actual analysis. Include information like your hypothesis, data visualizations, and anything else that can tell the story in the data.

### Summary
Sum up what you learned in your analysis. If your analysis is something that has real world applications, you can write how you would apply your findings in real-world situations here.

### Next Steps
This is optional- describe what else you would like to research using your data, or additioanl datasets you would like to find to bolster your analysis
